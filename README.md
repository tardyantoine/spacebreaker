Summary
------

A Nintendo DS based game, crossing Tetris with Ball Breaker

Details

The game is played against a friend or the AI. The goal is to bounce the ball without dropping it on the floor and break rows of bricks. Every row you break is added to your opponent's space, until a threshold is crossed

To play against a friend, place yourself on each end of the DS and use the left and right triggers with your thumbs!
